# Agile was never enough

There have been discussions and thinkpieces for years about whether agile has _won_ or if it has merely been absorbed, and corrupted, by a culture that never quite understood its principles and never really cared. It is undeniable that agile has had an impact on the world of software development: it is now difficult to find a company that does not try to sell prospective employees on the scope of their _agile transformation_ or expect a strong understanding of working with _the agile process_ regardless of how genuine either of those claims is. The descriptions might be overblown, but it would not be fair to say that agile has not had an impact on the ways that these organisations work - a standup meeting where developers awkwardly say which ticket numbers they're working on still offers some form of regular communication beyond an occasional rumour or dressed up status report for a manager. Agile may not have won, but it has definitely left its mark and it is worth remembering that in many ways that mark is positive.

But what if it had won?

If teams worked collaboratively, consistently producing high quality code that was regularly released to a customer and the insights from that fed back into further improvements in the product? If developers maintained regular contact with business people to ensure that customer satisfaction was always maintained as a central focus, then regularly took time to reflect over how things were going and to make adjustments as necessary? Wouldn't that be better? I do not doubt that it would be, but...
