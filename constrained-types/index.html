                    Using the right types can help make your code cleaner and easier to understand, 
                    it can also save you writing a bunch of boilerplate code by encapsulating it in
                    the right place. The downside is that it takes a bit more thought than just 
                    using primitives for everything, but I believe in you! You can totes do this!
                </p>
                <h3>Super Exciting Example</h3>
                <p>
                    Imagine that you're developing the next billion dollar app <em>Poopr</em> - 
                    which sends notifications when you poop. You are clearly a rockstar, ninja 
                    developer and you are going to <em>revolutionize</em> this codebase with your mad
                    skillz (in constrained types.) So let's take a look at the current state of affairs, 
                    by looking at the main notify function:
                </p>
                <code>
                    public void Notify(
                        string recipientEmail,
                        string senderEmail,
                        string Body)
                    {
                        //...call a web service to send the notification
                    }
                </code>
                <h3>Parts Become Whole</h3>
                <p>
                    Our first consideration about these parameters is if they would be used 
                    individually or if they only make sense together. For sending a notification 
                    like this, it's clear that they're all required for it to be sent so it makes
                    sense to put them all together in one type. Given that they are all 
                    required for this to work, it doesn't make any sense to let any of them be 
                    null either, so we should guard against that before we go further to ensure 
                    that our prerequisites are met before attempting to send a notification.
                </p>
                <code>
                    public class Notification
                    {
                        public string RecipientEmail { get; }
                        public string SenderEmail { get; }
                        public string Body { get; }
                        
                        public Notification(
                            string recipientEmail,
                            string senderEmail
                            string body)
                        {
                            if(string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(recipientEmail))
                                throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(recipientEmail));
                            if(string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(senderEmail))
                                throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(senderEmail));
                            if(string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(body))
                                throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(body));
                                
                            RecipientEmail = recipientEmail;
                            SenderEmail = senderEmail;
                            Body = body;
                        }
                    }
                    
                    public void Notify(Notification notification)
                    {
                        if(notification == null)
                            throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(notification));
                            
                        //...call a web service to send the notification
                    }
                </code>
