              When a client requests data from an API it may only want a subset of
              available fields, but many APIs only offer a single representation of
              available data. We can use
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_negotiation">Content Negotiation</a>
              for more than just choosing between json or xml (or whatever)
              and provide exactly what a client asks for.
          </p>
          <h3>A Sample API</h3>
          <p>
              Many applications use the concept of a collection of items that
              belong to a user, so here we'll use a collection of favourite
              colours<a href="#footnote-1" class="footnote-link">1</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
              We can define a simple <code>my-colours</code> endpoint in F# using
              <a href="https://github.com/giraffe-fsharp/giraffe">Giraffe</a>:
          </p>
          <script src="https://gist.github.com/chamook/88fd1442a69350e5eec382110b1ae902.js"></script>
          <p>
              This defines a <code>Colour</code> type that contains a few different
              properties, and makes a collection of them available via <code>GET</code>
              request. It returns a hardcoded list of values, but it's just an
              example so that's ok.
          </p>
          <p>
              We can also create a simple client to retrieve the data from the endpoint
              and display it to an end user. The sample swift code is part of an iOS app
              using <code>URLSession</code> and the <code>Decodable</code> protocol to
              make things easy:
          </p>
          <script src="https://gist.github.com/chamook/ba052a104197023689095ac29ea9581b.js"></script>
          <p>
              This works pretty well, but we can already see that there's a mismatch
              between the data that the API provides and the data that the client
              actually needs - the API returns a bunch of fields that the client
              doesn't care about.
              For this sample API it's not much of an issue, but
              if we had a lot of entries in the list or our colour object was more
              complex it could become a problem. Fortunately, we have some ways to
              match our API to the needs of the client.
          </p>
          <h3>A New Media Type</h3>
          <p>
              We can't <em>just</em> remove values from our API response because
              there may be other clients relying on that data, but if we provide
              a way for a client to ask for a different response then we can
              give each client a response containing the data that it needs.
          </p>
          <p>
              First, we need to configure Giraffe to support custom media types.
              We don't need any custom serialization for this, so we can just
              use the json serializer that's already configured.
          </p>
          <script src="https://gist.github.com/chamook/4f7fdb4a2257d6ae89027dfd2f374abf.js"></script>
          <p>
              Then we can create a custom representation of <code>Colours</code>
              and return it from our endpoint for clients that request the mini
              version.
          </p>
          <script src="https://gist.github.com/chamook/6561ca0b26e9053a050b144d69eb0ceb.js"></script>
          <p>
              With our API configured to return the mini colour response to
              clients that request it, we can update our app client to send the
              new <code>Accept</code> header. Handily, for our swift client it's
              trivial to set an extra header:
          </p>
          <script src="https://gist.github.com/chamook/b793d64db5558dd4dcea24d922bada71.js"></script>
          <p>
              Now our client requests a specific response and our API provides it,
              which is great...for now. However, this does leave our API and client
              coupled together - if our clients needs change in the future, then
              our API will also need to be updated even if it could already
              provide the field, our only options are all or nothing.
          </p>
          <h3>Asking For What We Need</h3>
          <p>
              We want to find a way that our client can adjust the data it gets
              from the API as it needs <em>without us needing to make changes to
              the API</em>. This means that we'll need some way for a client to
              describe the data that it wishes to recieve from the API.
          </p>
          <p>
              There are a few existing ways of describing the shape of data an
              API should return to a client, notably
              <a href="https://graphql.org/">GraphQL</a> and
              <a href="https://jsonapi.org/format/#fetching-sparse-fieldsets">JSON:API</a>,
              so it might be worth considering how to implement this in a way
              that doesn't necessarily tie us to any particular implementation
              in the future in case we change preference later on, or especially
              in the case that we have different API clients with differing needs.
          </p>
          <p>
              <a href="https://introspected.rest/#92-microtypes-reusable-modules-composing-a-media-type">
                  Introspected ReST
              </a> suggests using <em>MicroTypes</em> as a way of composing a media
              type. Using that approach, we can add one method of filtering now and
              then add support for different approaches later without breaking any
              clients. So we'll need to make the following changes:
          </p>
          <dl>
              <dt>
                  Switch our API to use a media type that can support filtering
              </dt>
              <dd>
                  We'll use a general api media type: <code>application/vnd.chamook.api+json</code>
                  that could work across any apis connected with this one.
                  We don't use something like <code>application/json</code> because
                  we can't guarantee that an API returning plain old json will
                  support filtering (or any other features we wanted to add).
              </dd>
              <dt>
                  Define a filtering syntax that our client can use
              </dt>
              <dd>
                  We could use one of the fancy options mentioned earlier. But for
                  now we only want a very simple filter, so a custom field list
                  will probably be easier to implement. Because we're using
                  MicroTypes we could always add support for something fancy
                  like GraphQL later if it turned out we needed it.
              </dd>
              <dt>Update our client to use the new filtering method</dt>
              <dd>
                  Once this update is done, our client and API should be nicely
                  decoupled for any future changes to filtering.
              </dd>
          </dl>
          <p>
              We could potentially add on ways for the API to describe available
              filtering options to a client, but if we don't want to go <em>all in</em>
              on a ReSTful approach with this API we could just leave that as
              something to be included in documentation - as long as we follow
              common conventions across our API surface it shouldn't be too
              problematic.
          </p>
          <h3>The Final Form(s)</h3>
          <p>
              With that decided, we can update our API with the following code
              (using the simplest filtering approach, by specifying which fields
              should be included in the response as a parameter to the media type):
          </p>
          <script src="https://gist.github.com/chamook/e3eddb01718aae12c3348e23c409d6f7.js"></script>
          <p>
              Our client needs only minor changes to use the new version:
          </p>
          <script src="https://gist.github.com/chamook/4e4e3a5400e8aea9c51239a625bead2c.js"></script>
          <p>
              Now our client can specify exactly the fields it wants, and our API
              will respond appropriately. There are still things that could be
              improved, but this is enough for now.
