					Object oriented developers love patterns. 
					<abbr title="Every once in a while, I suppose">Sometimes</abbr>
					these patterns are useful and make code easier to understand, 
					<abbr title="Most of the time">other times</abbr> they are 
					just included for the sake of using patterns. The overuse is 
					probably because they have goofy sounding names. One of the 
					patterns that often has the most dubious value is the 
					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_method_pattern">
					Factory Pattern</a>, wherein we create a whole different object
					that can then create the object we actually wanted for us. 
					This pattern does have some merit in that it can aid in making 
					code reusable, or can abstract away some concerns - however, 
					over eager <abbr title="Object Oriented Programming">OOP</abbr>
					practitioners will sometimes make a factory that effectively 
					just calls a constructor for one type, and takes all the 
					parameters that that constructor needs - which makes it just 
					an annoying piece of indirection.
				</p>
				<p>
					To counter patterns with goofy names, we must use 
					refactorings with equally goofy names (it's the only way).
					So, to aid in removing pointless factories we have:
				</p>
				<h2>
					The Capital Fund Refactoring
				</h2>
				<p>
					Wherein, we extract the value from a factory and leave it 
					defunct. Just like a real capital fund, we also ignore the plight
					of the workers in that factory who now struggle to feed their 
					families.
				</p>
				<h2>An exciting and representative example</h2>
				<p>Consider this super useful factory:</p>
<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp"><span class="k">public</span> <span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">ThingFactory</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">public</span> <span class="kt">string</span> <span class="n">ThingName</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="k">get</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="p">}</span>

        <span class="n">ThingName</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="n">thingName</span><span class="p">;</span>
        <span class="n">ThingValue</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="n">thingValue</span><span class="p">;</span>

    <span class="p">{</span>

        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nf">Thing</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">ThingName</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">ThingValue</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">elusiveThirdParameter</span><span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>
				<p>
					It looks trivial, but it's honestly not far from a factory I
					really saw out in the wild recently - you're welcome to imagine 
					a slightly more useful example if it helps though.
				</p>
				<p>
					The example I found was used only twice and both of those in 
					the same <code>ApiController</code>, both called like this:
				</p>
        <figure class="highlight">
            <pre>
<code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp"><span class="c1">//lurking within other code</span>

<span class="kt">var</span> <span class="n">thingFac</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nf">ThingFactory</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">myThingName</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">myThingVal</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="kt">var</span> <span class="n">thing</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="n">thingFac</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">MakeThing</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">thirdParam</span><span class="p">);</span></code></pre>
        </figure>
				<p>
					So it was trivial to apply the <em>Capital Fund</em> refactoring, 
					and move the object creation to a private static method nearby:
				</p>
<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp"><span class="k">private</span> <span class="k">static</span> <span class="n">Thing</span> <span class="nf">MakeThing</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">string</span> <span class="n">thingName</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">thingVal</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kt">string</span> <span class="n">thirdParam</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">thingName</span> <span class="p">==</span> <span class="k">null</span><span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="k">throw</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nf">ArgumentNullException</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">nameof</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">thingName</span><span class="p">));</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">thirdParam</span> <span class="p">==</span> <span class="k">null</span><span class="p">)</span>

    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nf">Thing</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">thingName</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">thingVal</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">thirdParam</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>
				<h2>What even is the point of that?</h2>
				<p>
					It's easy to dismiss this change as pointless, and in such a 
					trivial example it mostly is - but, for factories that are 
					only used in one place it's a good way to remove an unnecessary 
					and potentially confusing abstraction so that you can find a 
					better one.
				</p>
				<p>
					To be clear, I am not saying the factory pattern is 
					<em>always</em> a bad idea, but often it is used without 
					considering the value that it adds and can often be the 
					wrong thing to use in a given circumstance - just removing 
					the factory often isn't enough to improve the readability of
					the code, but by moving the methods it provides closer to 
					where they are used it can be much easier to reason about the 
					code and find a better abstraction. So, it is worth considering 
					these points before mindlessly applying this refactoring:
				</p>
				<h2>Guidelines</h2>
				<h3>Good times to apply this:</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>When a factory is used very few times</li>
					<li>When a factory can trivially be replaced with a constructor call</li>
					<li>When a factory very clearly returns a concrete type</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Bad times to apply this:</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>When a factory is used in a bunch of places</li>
					<li>When a factory nicely separates out logic about creating 
						something that would otherwise be boring and repetitive</li>
				</ul>
				<h2>Is this the end?</h2>
				<p>
					The <em>Capital Fund</em> refactoring helps remove an unnecessary
					indirection from your code, but it's important to note that 
					this refactoring alone doesn't necessarily leave you with 
					<em>better</em> code. The aim of this refactoring is to make 
					things clearer so that you can continue on to develop an 
					abstraction that makes more sense. Unless the use of a factory 
					was <em>completely</em> pointless, in which case you might just
					want to offer <del>mean</del> kind words of support to whoever
					added it in the first place, in the hope that you don't have 
					to apply this refactoring too many times.
