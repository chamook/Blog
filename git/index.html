					Git is a really cool source control system that can 
					do loads of things and works really well and stuff.
					But if you've never used it before and haven't really
					learned how to use it right it sucks and is shit and 
					seems like a massive chore for very little benefit.
					This article should help to give you some tiny level 
					of understanding of how to use basic git stuff in a
					way that doesn't suck and lets you reap some of the 
					benefits of using it.
				</p>
				<h2>
					Stop using sucky tools and do things properly
				</h2>
				<p>
					There are a lot of applications that are designed to 
					give you a shiny interface for working with Git, and 
					they probably made you think "oh hay cool, pres butan
					ftw lol!!1" but they are BAD and WRONG!
					<a href="#footnote-1" class="footnote-link">1</a>
					If you want to have a proper understanding of what 
					you're doing  and you want access to all the tools it 
					provides, you should run it from the command prompt
					because that's what it was made for. This is not as 
					scary and difficult as it sounds. Plus you'll look 
					<b>really</b> pro.
				</p>
				<p>
					To get started, you will obviously need to download and install 
					<a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">git</a> and then 
					you'll want to install <a href="http://conemu.github.io/">
					ConEmu</a> because it makes working on the command line 
					not terrible. That's it for software setup.
				</p>
				<h2>Type words, make things happen</h2>
				<p>
					There are a few bash commands that it's worth being familiar with:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<code>cd &lt;path&gt;</code> - Change directory just 
						like in a windows command prompt, so 
						<code>cd c/development/my-dumb-project/</code>	would 
						take you to	c:\development\my-dumb-project
					</li>
					<li>
						<code>ls</code> - lists the contents of a directory
					</li>
					<li>
						<code>rm &lt;filename&gt;</code> - deletes a file,
						I only use this when I type something wrong and 
						end up making an empty file called sqhel
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Then you'll also need git commands for doing actual git things:
				</p>
				<ul>
                    <li>
						<code>git status</code> - tells you the current status of 
                        the repository (changes in your working copy, staged changes, 
                        other stuff) also tends to tell you what you can do next, so it's
                        super handy if you get stuck
					</li>
					<li>
						<code>git init</code> - creates a repository in the 
						current folder (gosh that was easy)
					</li>
					<li>
						<code>git branch &lt;branchname&gt;</code> - makes a new 
						branch with the given name
					</li>
					<li>
						<code>git checkout &lt;branchname&gt;</code> - switches 
						branch to the one specified
					</li>
					<li>
						<code>git add -A</code> - adds all your pending changes to
						staging
					</li>
					<li>
						<code>git add &lt;file&gt;</code> - adds just the specified 
						file's changes to staging
					</li>
					<li>
						<code>git commit -m "&lt;message&gt;"</code> - makes a commit 
						with all the changes in staging and gives it the specified
						message
					</li>	
					<li>
						<code>git log</code> - lists the commit history, most recent
						first (press <code>q</code> to make it stop)
					</li>	
					<li>
						<code>git merge &lt;branchname&gt;</code> - merges the
						specified branch onto your current branch
					</li>	
					<li>
						<code>git rebase &lt;branchname&gt;</code> - rewrite history 
						in your own image
					</li>	
				</ul>
				<p>
					That covers the basics for working with your local repository, but 
					when you're working with other people you'll also need a remote 
					repository somewhere to sync against. And that involves a few more 
					commands:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<code>git remote add origin &lt;url&gt;</code> - Adds a remote 
						called origin with the specified url (like that url that 
						<a href="http://www.github.com/">github</a> gives you for your 
						repository<a href="#footnote-2" class="footnote-link">2</a>) 
					</li>
					<li>
						<code>git pull</code> - pulls down any changes on the remote to 
						your local copy
					</li>
					<li>
						<code>git push origin HEAD</code> - pushes any new commits you 
						have made on your current branch up to the remote origin (HEAD 
						refers to the tip of your branch)
					</li>
				</ul>
                <h2>Don't panic if you end up in vim!</h2>
                <p>
                    Vim is some fancy text editor thing that people who are way nerdier 
                    than me think is awesome - the shell will possibly dump you there 
                    when you do things with git and it needs you to type a message or 
                    something. It looks weird and scary, but don't panic! It's built 
                    around having a lot of flashy keyboard shortcuts, but if you press
                    the <code>insert</code> key on your keyboard you'll go into regular 
                    text editing mode (like how other editors are) and when you're done
                    making changes press <code>escape</code> and then type <code>:wq</code> 
                    which means Write and Quit and you're outta there.
                </p>
				<h2>Git as you go</h2>
				<p>
					Knowing the commands is one thing (one very important thing, but still)
					but the really important part is using them well and fitting them into 
					your workflow. So what is a good approach with all this stuff?
				</p>
				<h4>Always work on branches</h4>
				<p>
					Importantly, not the master branch. Branches are good because they 
					keep all your work on a particular thing isolated - if you're half
					way through something and you find a bug in your main build that 
					<em>needs</em> to be fixed <em>now</em> it's really good that you 
					can just commit any changes to your branch, make a new bugfix branch 
					from master and get that fix in, without having to undo any of your
					in-progress work. 
				</p>
				<p>
					It's also nice that your master branch can be a rock solid pillar of
					stability, until any code you're working on really is done and ready
					to join it. When you're starting a new line of development, either a 
					feature or bugfix, you should start a new branch from master
					<a href="#footnote-3" class="footnote-link">3</a>:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li><code>git checkout master</code></li>
					<li><code>git pull</code></li>
					<li><code>git branch my-awesome-new-branch</code></li>
					<li><code>git checkout my-awesome-new-branch</code></li>
				</ul>
                <p>
					First change to the master branch and pull any changes from origin 
					to ensure that your local copy of master is up to date with any 
					remote changes. Then create a new branch - here creatively titled 
					my-awesome-new-branch but it's probably a good idea to go with a 
					more descriptive name - and then check it out ready to be worked on.
				</p>
                <p>Or if you're a super fast speedy person, you could just go:</p>
                <ul>
					<li><code>git checkout master</code></li>
					<li><code>git pull</code></li>
					<li><code>git checkout -b my-awesome-new-branch</code></li>
				</ul>
                <p>The -b switch on checkout will make a new branch if it doesn't already exist</p>
				<h4>Commit often, push less often</h4>
				<p>
					Make a <em>lot</em> of commits. Each commit should be the smallest 
					change you could've made without breaking everything. If you add a
					line inside a method that doesn't change the outcome (so everything
					still builds and tests still pass) that's a commit. If you change 
					the signature of a method, then you would also need to change all the
					callers before commiting.
				</p> 
                <p>
                    If you make a commit, then realise you forgot to add something to it 
                    (because sometimes you're silly like that) you can add that change with
                    <code>git add &lt;file&gt;</code> and then use <code>git commit --amend</code>
                    to sneakily add it to the last commit, instead of cluttering things up
                    with 3 commits for the same thing.
                </p>
				<p>
					Before you push your branch and share your commits with everyone else,
					it's a lot easier for you to change them (and it won't mess up 
					anyone else's flow) - so don't push until you're happy with the state 
					of a branch. If it's a particularly long lived branch, you might want 
					to push periodically just to have it backed up, but generally try to 
					avoid long lived branches anyways because they are a pain to work with.
				</p>	
				<h4>Write good commit messages</h4>
				<p>
					Every commit in your history should have a descriptive, easy to 
					understand message that says what it changes and in a lot of cases
					why it makes that change. It should be a note to a future 
					developer (or just as likely future you) that explains the 
					reasoning for changing the code in a clear, concise way so that
					you're not baffled by a change in 6 months with no one to turn to 
					for answers.
				</p>			
				<p>
					It's a good rule of thumb to have all your commit messages finish this 
					sentence:
				</p>			
				<blockquote>If applied, this commit will...</blockquote>
				<p>
					All of this is explained much better than I can manage in
					<a href="http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/">this very good
					article</a>.
				</p>
				<h4>If not now, then at least later</h4>
				<p>
					Sometimes you're in the middle of changing a bunch of things, got a 
					mad good flow going on and really don't wanna break it up by writing 
					beautiful, poetic commit messages. Fortunately, you can use a temporary
					message for now and then fix it up later with the secret voodoo of
					interactive rebasing (<code>git rebase -i</code>)
				</p>
				<p>
					An interactive rebase lets you go through all the commits after a 
					starting point of your choosing and fuck around with them. You 
					can split them apart into more commits, squash them together into
					fewer, even add and remove changes from each one or get rid of a 
					commit entirely. But a very handy thing to do if you suck at 
					writing commit messages first time, is that you can change the commit 
					messages.
				</p>
				<p>
					So code away, get your flow on real good and make nice small commits 
					with temporary messages just for you. Then, when you're done rebase 
					interactively from the commit before your changes and make all those 
					messages beautiful:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<code>git rebase -i &lt;commit id&gt;</code>
					</li>
				</ul> 
				<h2>Share with others</h2>
				<p>
					When you've finished a feature (or part of a feature depending on
					the size of it) it's time to make a pull request and get your work 
					merged into the rest of the code. Making a good pull request helps 
					other developers review your code and make sure you didn't do 
					something dumb. Read 
					<a href="http://blog.ploeh.dk/2015/01/15/10-tips-for-better-pull-requests/">
					this cool article</a> for some pointers on how to make your pull request
					the best it can be, and help everyone out by making it easier to review.
